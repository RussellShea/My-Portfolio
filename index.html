          My name is Russell Sheathelm, but it actually wasn't the name assigned to me at birth.
          It was actually Kim, Min-Woo.
          I was adopted and hence relinquished from South Korea when I was around 5 months old.
          I grew up in Rocky Hill, Connecticut where I still reside after 21 years of life.
          I live with my parents, my sister Tia, and my two dogs Ziggy and Oakley.
          I am a moody optimist, eager to learn and eager to converse and collaborate.
          I would describe myself as obsessive and hard-working, caring and reliable, 
          intelligent yet sensible. A fun fact about me is I ran an ebay store selling 
          used vintage electronics such as CRT monitors and early 2000s computers.  

          I am an artist, a guitarist, a gamer, and a homebody extroverted walking contradiction. 

          I am currently a student for Trilogy's Coding BootCamp offered by UCONN. I am available 
          to meet and am looking forward to receiving your call/email.
